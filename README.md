# ShaderGraphDemo_ComicShader
Example Project that demos how to make a comic book style shader with Shader Graph


**This Project is intended to work with Unity release [2019.2](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/update) 
and Lightweight Render Pipeline version 6.9.1 or greater**


This demo project contains an example of a stylized comic book style created with Shader Graph. 
To achieve this effect this project uses the Custom Function node to write a custom lighting shader for the 
Lightweight Render Pipeline.
